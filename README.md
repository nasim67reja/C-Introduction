# CPP BASICS

## Hello world in CPP

```c++
// This brings in the iostream library
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world";
    return 0;
}

```

## Comments

It's similar like JavaScript

- `//` Comments out a single line
- `/*..*/` Block Comments out a block of text
- `/*..*/` Block comments can't be nested
- Use comments to document your code.Don't overdo it though.
